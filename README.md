## ðŸ“Š Power BI Portfolio

Welcome to my Power BI Portfolio! ðŸš€
This repository showcases a collection of Power BI projects developed as part of my learning journey and portfolio building.

Each project is based on relational database schemas that I previously designed and implemented in MySQL (see ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/CamilaVHeuer/portfolio-database). The idea is to connect structured datasets with Power BI, apply data transformation and modeling, and finally create interactive dashboards that provide insights for decision-making.

## ðŸŽ¯ Portfolio Goals

- Demonstrate end-to-end data handling: from SQL relational models to Power BI dashboards.
- Apply ETL processes using Power Query and calculated measures with DAX.
- Build dashboards that combine business logic, KPIs, and storytelling.
- Explore different industries/domains while keeping the same database foundation for consistency.
